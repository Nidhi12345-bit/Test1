All the steps are covered in the code: 
I was using eclipse ide in which I used selenium with java to implement this code.

in below project I have used concept of streaming and normal locator to find out the webelemnt from the DOM.

● Create an automation project with any automation tool.
● Open https://www.saucedemo.com/ in the browser
● Login using given username and password provided on the site
● Search and select "Sauce Labs Fleece Jacket" from page
● Go to the product detail page
● Click on "ADD TO CART"
● Click on "GO TO CART"
● Click on "CHECKOUT”
● Enter Checkout Information and click on Continue
● Print “Payment Information” on the next page and “Total price”

Note: we can also optimize this code by using abstract class and using page factory concept.
